description: 'The purpose of this unit is to give a brief survey about the cohomology
  and

  the tautological rings of the moduli space of curves. The file discusses about Teichmuller
  theory, the stable cohomology of Mg, Mumford''s conjecture and some small homology
  groups of the moduli space of curves.'
